# Europeana-Art-Map

We are MSc KU Leuven students in Digital Humanities: Elizaveta Berquin, Lisa Gregoire, Qiuzi Guo and Flora Monozlai. Our final project for the Web Information Systems class is a web application that searches Europeana's collection for objects and displays their locations or provider institutions on an interactive map. Europeana website can be a bit clustered for users. To try to combat this, this website would provide the user with locations, so they can determine in which institutions these objects are located and where these institutions in return are located.

The goals of this project are: 
1. Provide the user with a more user-friendly experience whilst browsing the Europeana collection;
2. Giving users the location of an institution that these objects can be found at;
3. Bring awareness to the institutions themselves.

Come explore cultural heritage with us!
